## 🏗️ Development Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Python Analysis
- [x] Data loading & cleaning
- [x] EDA: Medal tally, sport trends, visual insights

### 🔄 Phase 2: Power BI Integration *(Coming Soon)*
- [ ] Build an interactive dashboard for:
  - Country medal breakdown
  - Medal trend filters by sport/year
  - Top 10 nations by medal type

### 🧮 Phase 3: SQL Analysis Layer *(Coming Soon)*
- [ ] Import dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL
- [ ] Write queries for:
  - Medal count by country
  - Sports with most medals
  - Countries winning gold in every edition
- [ ] Combine SQL + Python for hybrid insights

### 🧠 Phase 4: Athlete-Level & ML Insights
- [ ] Enrich data with athlete metadata
- [ ] Predict next-Olympic medal tallies using ML
